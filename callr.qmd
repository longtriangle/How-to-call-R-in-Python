## Slide 1: Why we want R 

- Statistical functions and hypothesis testing can easily be done with built-in
functions
- Exploratory data analysis is more natural with tidyverse
- Data visualization ggplot2 is better than plotnine

---

## Slide 2: Why we want Python

- Data processing is more efficient with pandas; bigger data with Dask or
PySpark
- Automate daily and repetitive tasks with scripts and pipelines
- Preferred for machine learning and AI. Packages like scikit-learn for machine
learning, and PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning/ neural networks
